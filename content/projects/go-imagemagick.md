A few months ago I've spent some days developing my first cgo binding and the chosen library was <a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/script/magick-wand.php" title="MagickWand" target="_blank">ImageMagick's MagickWand</a>.

It was an interesting experience. It's relatively very easy to do such thing in Go. I'm still not using this binding in production and I hope someone can try it.
